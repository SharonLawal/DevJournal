## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
- **Angular CLI:** `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- A **MongoDB** database (either local or a free Atlas cluster)
- A **Cloudinary** account for image uploads
- A **Google AI API Key** for Genkit/Gemini features

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SharonLawal/DevJournal.git
    cd DevJournal
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend**
    - Navigate to the backend directory:
      ```sh
      cd backend
      ```
    - Install the backend dependencies:
      ```sh
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:
      ```env
      PORT=5000
      MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
      
      # Cloudinary Credentials
      CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
      CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
      CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

      # Google Gemini API Key
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
      ```
    - Start the backend server:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend**
    - Open a **new terminal window**.
    - Navigate to the frontend directory:
      ```sh
      cd frontend
      ```
    - Install the frontend dependencies. The `.npmrc` file in this directory will automatically handle peer dependency issues.
      ```sh
      npm install
      ```
    - Make sure your frontend knows where the API is running. Open `frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` and set the `apiUrl`:
      ```typescript
      export const environment = {
        production: false,
        apiUrl: 'http://localhost:5000/api'
      };
      ```
    - Start the Angular development server:
      ```sh
      ng serve
      ```
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. The application should now be fully functional.
